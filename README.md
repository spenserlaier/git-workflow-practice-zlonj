## What is interesting about this post ##
For a long time, MacOS has been regarded as the most user-friendly operating system by many. The writer of this article shares some details that annoy them. One of these details, which the writer claims to be annoying, is that pressing enter when selecting a file renames the file. This is actually one of my most used shortcuts on MacOS and a little detail that I really like myself. This is really interesting because it shows how a design decision can be liked and hated by people at the same time. Another detail the writer writes is that after closing an app it still runs in the background. For example, when someone closes the last tab on chrome, chrome is not closed as they can see on the left corner of the screen that chrome is still running. The writer says this is annoying because people can accidentally run over 10 apps in the background. However, to me, this is quite useful. There are some apps on my mac that take a long time to start, so there are times I really don't want them to be easily killed. For example, some IDEs take a long time to start, such as IntelliJ, and if closing the last project in IntelliJ closes the whole software, I would be frustrated every time I want to switch to a different project. It is interesting to see that some designs in the operating system that I like are annoying to others because it shows how different people's habits are when it comes to using their computers.
