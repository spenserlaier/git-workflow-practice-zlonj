For a long time, MacOS has been regarded as the most user-friendly operating system by many. The writer of this article shares some details that annoy them. One of these details, which the writer claims to be annoying, is that pressing enter when selecting a file renames the file. This is actually one of my most used shortcuts on MacOS and a little detail that I really like myself. This is really interesting because it shows how a design decision can be liked and hated by people at the same time. Another detail the writer writes is that after closing an app it still runs in the background. For example, when someone closes the last tab on chrome, chrome is not closed as they can see on the left corner of the screen that chrome is still running. The writer says this is annoying because people can accidentally run over 10 apps in the background. However, to me, this is quite useful. There are some apps on my mac that take a long time to start, so there are times I really don't want them to be easily killed. For example, some IDEs take a long time to start, such as IntelliJ, and if closing the last project in IntelliJ closes the whole software, I would be frustrated every time I want to switch to a different project. It is interesting to see that some designs in the operating system that I like are annoying to others because it shows the drastic difference between people's habits of using their computers and operating systems.

Spenser Laier: I found myself agreeing with some of the points,
like the one about the unintuitiveness of cutting files instead of copying
and pasting them, and the at-times awkward navigation of the window
manager. I didn't know it could be changed with apps like Amethyst,
so I might look into that.

I've never really thought too much about what I didn't like about MacOS. Although members of my family prefer windows, I've always used a Mac. As I got older and began taking comp sci courses, I've found it easier to work with MacOS beccause of its unix-like OS. The command line is user friendly and hasn't given me as many problems as trying to use Windows Command Prompt. I also really enjoy MacOS because it allows me to get the most out of my other Apple devices. I can use my iPad as a second display and easily share files across my devices.
